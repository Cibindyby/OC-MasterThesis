	abstract = {This work presents and evaluates a novel modification to existing mutation operators for Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP). We discuss and highlight a so far unresearched limitation of how CGP explores its search space which is caused by certain nodes being inactive for long periods of time. Our new mutation operator is intended to avoid this by associating each node with a dynamically changing weight. When mutating a connection between nodes, those weights are then used to bias the probability distribution in favour of inactive nodes. This way, inactive nodes have a higher probability of becoming active again. We include our mutation operator into two variants of CGP and benchmark both versions on four Boolean learning tasks. We analyse the average numbers of iterations a node is inactive and show that our modification has the intended effect on node activity. The influence of our modification on the number of iterations until a solution is reached is ambiguous if the same number of nodes is used as in the baseline without our modification. However, our results show that our new mutation operator leads to fewer nodes being required for the same performance; this saves CPU time in each iteration.},

	abstract = {In this letter, a constructive solution to the N-bit parity problem is provided with a neural network that allows direct connections between the input layer and the output layer. The present approach requires no training and adaptation, and thus it warrants the use of the simple threshold activation function for the output and hidden layer neurons. It is previously shown that this choice of activation function and network structure leads to several solutions for the 3-bit parity problem obtained using linear programming. One of the solutions for the 3-bit parity problem is then generalized to obtain a solution for the N-bit parity problem using ⌊N/2⌋ hidden layer neurons. It is shown that through the choice of a “staircase” type activation function, the ⌊N/2⌋ hidden layer neurons can be further combined into a single hidden layer neuron.}

Since then, several benchmark suites in major GP problem domains have been proposed over time, which were able to fill some of the major gaps. In the framework of the first review about the state of benchmarking in GP, logic synthesis was classified as one of the major GP problem domains. However, a diverse and accessible benchmark suite for logic synthesis is still missing in the field of GP. In this work, we take a first step towards a benchmark suite for logic synthesis that covers different types of Boolean functions that are commonly used for the evaluation of GP systems. We also present baseline results that have been obtained by former work and in our evaluation experiments by using Cartesian Genetic Programming.},

However, in Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP), which is part of the aforementioned category, the usefulness of crossover is contested. In this work, we investigate whether CGP’s positional bias actually inﬂuences the usefulness of the crossover operator negatively. This bias describes a skewed distribution of CGP’s active and inactive nodes, which might lead to destructive behaviours of standard recombination operators. We try to answer our hypothesis by employing one standard CGP implementation and one without the eﬀects of positional bias. Both versions are combined with one of four standard crossover operators, or with no crossover operator. Additionally, two different selection methods are used to conﬁgure a CGP variant. We then analyse their performance and convergence behaviour on eight benchmarks taken from the Boolean and symbolic regression domain. By using Bayesian inference, we are able to rank them, and we found that positional bias does not inﬂuence CGP with crossover. Furthermore, we argue that the current research on CGP with standard crossover operators is incomplete, and CGP with recombination might not negatively impact its evolutionary search process. On the contrary, using CGP with crossover improves its performance.},

The advantage of the preferential selection of larger solutions is validated on the six, seven and eight-bit parity problems, on a dynamically varying problem involving the classification of binary patterns, and on the Paige regression problem. In all cases, the preferential selection of larger solutions provides an advantage in term of the performance of the evolved solutions and in term of speed, the number of evaluations required to evolve optimal or high-quality solutions. The advantage provided by the preferential selection of larger solutions can be further extended by self-adapting the mutation rate through the one-fifth success rule. Finally, for problems like the Paige regression in which neutrality plays a minor role, the advantage of the preferential selection of larger solutions can be extended by preferring larger solutions also among quasi-neutral alternative candidate solutions, i.e. solutions achieving slightly different performance.},

	abstract = {Genetic algorithm (GA) is an artiﬁcial intelligence search method that uses the process of evolution and natural selection theory and is under the umbrella of evolutionary computing algorithm. It is an efﬁcient tool for solving optimization problems. Integration among (GA) parameters is vital for successful (GA) search. Such parameters include mutation and crossover rates in addition to population that are important issues in (GA). However, each operator of GA has a special and different inﬂuence. The impact of these factors is inﬂuenced by their probabilities; it is difﬁcult to predeﬁne speciﬁc ratios for each parameter, particularly, mutation and crossover operators. This paper reviews various methods for choosing mutation and crossover ratios in GAs. Next, we deﬁne new deterministic control approaches for crossover and mutation rates, namely Dynamic Decreasing of high mutation ratio/dynamic increasing of low crossover ratio (DHM/ILC), and Dynamic Increasing of Low Mutation/Dynamic Decreasing of High Crossover (ILM/DHC). The dynamic nature of the proposed methods allows the ratios of both crossover and mutation operators to be changed linearly during the search progress, where (DHM/ILC) starts with 100\% ratio for mutations, and 0\% for crossovers. Both mutation and crossover ratios start to decrease and increase, respectively. By the end of the search process, the ratios will be 0\% for mutations and 100\% for crossovers. (ILM/DHC) worked the same but the other way around. The proposed approach was compared with two parameters tuning methods (predeﬁned), namely ﬁfty-ﬁfty crossover/mutation ratios, and the most common approach that uses static ratios such as (0.03) mutation rates and (0.9) crossover rates. The experiments were conducted on ten Traveling Salesman Problems (TSP). The experiments showed the effectiveness of the proposed (DHM/ILC) when dealing with small population size, while the proposed (ILM/DHC) was found to be more effective when using large population size. In fact, both proposed dynamic methods outperformed the predeﬁned methods compared in most cases tested.},

Crossover operation is responsible for producing offspring for the next generation so as to explore a much wider area of the solution space. There are many crossover operators designed to cater to different needs of different optimization problems. Despite the many analyses, it is still difficult to decide which crossover to use when. In this article, we have considered the various existing crossover operators based on the application for which they were designed for and the purpose that they were designed for. We have classified the existing crossover operators into two broad categories, namely (1) Crossover operators for representation of applications -- where the crossover operators designed to suit the representation aspect of applications are discussed along with how the crossover operators work and (2) Crossover operators for improving GA performance of applications -- where crossover operators designed to influence the quality of the solution and speed of GA are discussed. We have also come up with some interesting future directions in the area of designing new crossover operators as a result of our survey.},

In this paper, we introduce a new crossover for CGP when using a single genotype representation and the desired model has multiple outputs. The proposal modifies the standard evolutionary strategy commonly adopted in CGP by combining the subgraphs of the best outputs of the parent and its offspring in order to generate a new fittest individual. The proposed crossover is applied to combinational logic circuits with multiple outputs, a parameter analysis is performed, and the results obtained are compared to those found by a baseline CGP and other techniques from the literature.},

	abstract = {Genetic Programming (GP) is an intelligence technique whereby computer programs are encoded as a set of genes which are evolved utilizing a Genetic Algorithm (GA). In other words, the GP employs novel optimization techniques to modify computer programs; imitating the way humans develop programs by progressively re-writing them for solving problems automatically. Trial programs are frequently altered in the search for obtaining superior solutions due to the base is GA. These are evolutionary search techniques inspired by biological evolution such as mutation, reproduction, natural selection, recombination, and survival of the fittest. The power of GAs is being represented by an advancing range of applications; vector processing, quantum computing, VLSI circuit layout, and so on. But one of the most significant uses of GAs is the automatic generation of programs. Technically, the GP solves problems automatically without having to tell the computer specifically how to process it. To meet this requirement, the GP utilizes GAs to a “population” of trial programs, traditionally encoded in memory as tree-structures. Trial programs are estimated using a “fitness function” and the suited solutions picked for re-evaluation and modification such that this sequence is replicated until a “correct” program is generated. GP has represented its power by modifying a simple program for categorizing news stories, executing optical character recognition, medical signal filters, and for target identification, etc. This paper reviews existing literature regarding the GPs and their applications in different scientific fields and aims to provide an easy understanding of various types of GPs for beginners.},

	abstract = {In image classiﬁcation problems, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are deep neural networks that include a variety of different layers aimed at classifying images. Until today, the most promising and state-of-the-art method in image recognition tasks is CNN. Tuning the deep network with a large number of hyperparameters to maximize performance would be an excruciating task that requires lots of time and engineering efforts. To construct that high-performance architecture, experts should go through a lot of trial and error. Neural Architecture Search is a way to automatically fabricate an accurate network architecture. An evolutionary algorithm called Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) with a new crossover operation based on the multiple Sequence Alignment algorithm is proposed in this paper to construct an appropriate neural network without the burden of building manually. This new method has a remarkable improvement over a standard CGP only by adding a crossover operator. The datasets for training on the proposed method were CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The results show that it achieves a good balance between accuracy and the number of trainable parameters compared to the other state-of-the-art methods.},

The purpose of natural language processing is to allow us to communicate with computers in natural language. Among the problems addressed in the area is, for example, the extraction of information, which draws relevant data from unstructured texts written in natural language. There are also domains of application of particular relevance because of the difficulty in dealing with the corresponding documents, such as opinion mining in social networks, or because of the need for high precision in the information extracted, such as the biomedical domain. There have been proposals to apply genetic programming techniques in several of these areas. This tour allows us to observe the potential—not yet fully exploited—of such applications. We also review some cases in which genetic programming can provide information that is absent from other approaches, revealing its ability to provide easy to interpret results, in form of programs or functions. Finally, we identify some important challenges in the area.},

	abstract = {Genetic algorithms (GA) has given rise to two new ﬁelds of research where (global) optimisation is of crucial importance: ‘genetic based machine learning’ (GBML) and ‘genetic programming’ (GP). An introduction by the authors to GA and GBML was given in two previous papers (Eng. Appl. Artif. Intell. 9(6) (1996) 681; Eng. Appl. Artif. Intell. 13(4) (2000) 381). In this paper, the last domain (GP) will be introduced, thereby making up a trilogy which gives a general overview of the whole ﬁeld. In this third part, an overview will be given of the basic concepts of GP as deﬁned by Koza. A ﬁrst (educational) example of GP is given by solving a simple symbolic regression of a sinus function. Finally, a more complex application is presented in which GP is used to construct the mathematical equations for an industrial process. To this end, the case study ‘ﬁbre-to-yarn production process’ is introduced. The goal of this study is the automatic development of mathematical equations for the prediction of spinnability and (possible) resulting yarn strength. It is shown that (relatively) simple equations can be obtained which describe accurately 90\% of the ﬁbre-to-yarn database. r 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},
